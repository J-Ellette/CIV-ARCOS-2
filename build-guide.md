# CIV-ARCOS Build Guide

## Civilian Assurance-based Risk Computation and Orchestration System

### Military-grade assurance for civilian code

## Project Overview

We are laying the foundation to build a "civilian" version of military-grade software assurance, while following proven ARCOS methodologies - perfect for open source projects, enterprise development teams, or as a SaaS offering. We will be creating the various parts of the system by emulating and perfecting existing technologies.

## Technologies We Will NOT Use

We won't be using the following technologies, but will take inspiration from and emulate them:

- Django
- FastAPI
- Flask
- Django ORM
- SQLAlchemy
- Peewee/Tortoise - Lighter ORMs
- Django-allauth
- Authlib
- PassLib
- Django Templates
- Jinja2
- Django REST Framework (DRF)
- Pydantic
- Django Cache Framework
- Redis-py / aioredis
- Django Admin
- Flask-Admin
- Django Security Middleware

## Technologies We Can Use

We will still use, if we need to, and if unable to emulate:

- pytest
- Coverage.py
- Black - Code Formatter
- MyPy - Type Checking
- Flake8 - Linting
- Docker

## Starting Base: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Start with:

- GitHub integration for code analysis
- Basic test coverage tracking
- Simple badge generation (test coverage + basic quality metrics)
- Web dashboard for viewing quality arguments
- REST API for badge embedding

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Evidence Collection Engine

Build a system similar to RACK (Rapid Assurance Curation Kit) - a semantic triplestore that normalizes and organizes evidence from different tools and formats while maintaining data provenance.

**Reference:** [RACK GitHub](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK) - Arcos-tools

**Implementation approach:**

- Create a graph database (inspiration: Neo4j or Apache Jena) for storing evidence relationships.
- Create adapters for popular development tools (GitHub, SonarQube, Jest, PyTest, etc.).
- Implement data provenance tracking with blockchain-like immutable audit trails.

### Step 2: Automated Test Evidence Generation

Follow GrammaTech's approach: enable automated test generation, execution, and test-suite maintenance to achieve measurably improved test coverage and completeness.

**Reference:** [GrammaTech](https://www.grammatech.com/) - International Defense Security & Technology

**Key components:**

- **Static Analysis Module:** Emulate and create tools like ESLint, Pylint, SonarQube.
- **Dynamic Testing:** Automated unit test generation using AI (similar to GitHub Copilot for tests, or local like ollama), or purely code driven - decided by user.
- **Coverage Analysis:** Track code coverage, branch coverage, mutation testing scores.
- **Security Scanning:** SAST/DAST integration with tools like CodeQL, Semgrep.

### Step 3: Digital Assurance Case Builder

Implement CertGATE-style Digital Assurance Cases (DACs) that automatically construct arguments from evidence using standard formalisms and templates.

**Reference:** [CertGATE](https://arcos-tools.org/tools/certgate) - AIAA/ACM Digital Library

**Technical implementation:**

- **Argument Templates:** Create reusable patterns for common quality arguments.
- **Evidence Linking:** Automatically connect test results, coverage data, and analysis to argument nodes.
- **GSN (Goal Structuring Notation):** Use established notation for visual argument representation.
- **Pattern Instantiation:** Auto-generate argument structures based on project type.

### Step 4: Quality Badge System

**Badge Categories:**

- Test Coverage (Bronze: >60%, Silver: >80%, Gold: >95%)
- Security Assurance (vulnerability scanning, dependency analysis)
- Code Quality (complexity metrics, maintainability index)
- Documentation (API docs, README quality, inline comments)
- Performance (load testing, profiling results)
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance for web apps)

## Implementation Stack

### Backend Architecture

Core stack recommendation:

- Emulate and recreate FastAPI or Django REST for API layer
- Emulate and recreate Neo4j for evidence graph storage
- Emulate and recreate PostgreSQL for metadata and user management
- Emulate and recreate Redis for caching and real-time updates
- Emulate and recreate Celery for background evidence processing

### Evidence Collection Pipeline

Example evidence collector structure:

```python
class EvidenceCollector:
    def collect_from_github(self, repo_url, commit_hash):
        # Pull code metrics, commit history, PR reviews
    
    def collect_from_ci(self, build_id):
        # Test results, coverage reports, performance metrics
    
    def collect_from_security_tools(self, scan_results):
        # Vulnerability reports, dependency analysis
```

### Assurance Case Engine

Follow NASA's AdvoCATE approach: automated pattern instantiation, hierarchical abstraction, and integration of formal methods into wider assurance arguments.

**Reference:** ResearchGate

```python
class AssuranceCase:
    def __init__(self, project):
        self.goals = []  # Top-level quality goals
        self.strategies = []  # How goals are broken down
        self.evidence = []  # Supporting evidence
        
    def auto_generate_from_template(self, template_type):
        # Generate case structure based on project type
        # Web app, mobile app, API, library, etc.
```

## Specific Technical Features

### 1. Real-time Quality Monitoring

- WebSocket connections for live quality score updates
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Automated evidence collection on every commit

### 2. AI-Powered Analysis

Implement AI-driven test case generation and quality assessment similar to TestGeniusAI approaches:

- Use LLMs to analyze code and suggest missing tests
- Generate quality improvement recommendations
- Predict quality risks based on code changes
- Use code driven architecture when LLM not available or desired

### 3. Blockchain Evidence Integrity

Follow Guardtime Federal's approach: use blockchain technology to secure the integrity of evidence data.

**Reference:** International Defense Security & Technology

- Immutable evidence timestamps
- Cryptographic proof of evidence authenticity
- Tamper-evident audit trails

### 4. Integration APIs

Example integration points:

```javascript
const qualityBadges = {
  github: {
    webhook: '/api/github/quality-check',
    badge_url: '/api/badge/{repo}/{branch}'
  },
  slack: {
    notifications: '/api/slack/quality-alerts'
  },
  jira: {
    quality_tickets: '/api/jira/quality-issues'
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

1. Begin with Step 1: Evidence Collection Engine
2. Implement the core graph database for evidence storage
3. Create basic evidence collectors
4. Build the REST API foundation
5. Implement badge generation
6. Create the web dashboard
7. Iterate and expand functionality

### Step 4.1 UI design

(re)build the frontend UI/GUI
Use the United States Web Design System: <https://github.com/uswds/uswds> as the UI.
Use <https://designsystem.digital.gov/> as the specif design to copy/emulate.

### Step 4.2 Emulation and incorporate

## CertGATE <https://arcos-tools.org/tools/certgate>

Every step of the certification process is aided by CertGATE. During development, it uses a library of patterns with data from the user to create Assurance Case Fragments: self-contained arguments for individual components or subsystems which may be linked to evidence artifacts, giving continuous feedback on certifiability strengths and weaknesses throughout the development lifecycle. CertGATE then enables assembly of may such fragments into an entire assurance case or performs other kinds of assurance case transformations through a domain-specific language (DSL) called the Argument Transformation Language (ArgTL). Assurance Cases maintained in CertGATE can be interrogated using our Assurance Case Query Language (ACQL), a mechanism for assessing assurance cases using a formal language extending the Object Constraint Language (OCL). During the review process, efficient user interfaces can support an inquisitive approach applied by reviewers and certifiers to determine requirement and objective satisfaction. The interfaces that generate ACQL statements sent to CertGATE are not part of the foundational CertGATE developed for DARPA. Finally, as the system is updated through its lifespan, CertGATE maintains its assurance case continuously, incorporating new evidence and fragments as changes are made.

## Automated Assurance Case Environment <https://arcos-tools.org/tools/automated-assurance-case-environment>

Tool and framework for automating and streamlining the creation, validation, and assessment of assurance cases. It has 4 core components:
(1) the Evidence Manager which can process, aggregate, and curate evidence from many sources within the DevSecOps;
(2) the pattern library, which is a collection of assurance patterns that incorporates a knowledge base of re-usable and modular patterns;
(3) the AC creation & assessment component, based on foundations from formal methods, automatically create, and validate the assurance case and estimate the associated risks based on the evidence;
(4) the Eval Tool, which is a developed-from-scratch user interface designed to be used by various decision makers for navigating, browsing, and exploring the status and details of the assurance case and the associated evidence.

## A-CERT (Advancing Certification Evidence, Rigor, and Traceability) <https://arcos-tools.org/tools/cert-advancing-certification-evidence-rigor-and-traceability>

A-CERT (Advancing Certification Evidence, Rigor, and Traceability) toolchain for automatic collection of evidence to support automated construction of assurance arguments for high-confidence software. A-CERT enables assurance of legacy systems as well as systems that make use of legacy and COTS components. A-CERT analyzes system implementation and documentation to infer the actual system architecture and map it against the intended system design, available as, e.g., a SysML model. This mapping exposes potential discrepancies between the implementation and design, e.g., missing functionality (e.g., unmet requirements and missing security controls) or extra functionality (e.g., backdoors intentionally introduced by the hackers or benign, but unneeded features that extend attack surface). It also enables a better assessment of implementation quality: low-level implementation weaknesses and structural code coverage are tracked to the high-level system modules they affect allowing analysts to better assess their safety and security implications. A-CERT toolchain comprises several tools to analyze, process, and collect different types of certification evidence. Collectively, these tools aim to generate high quality assurance evidence for legacy and COTS systems (we assume the absence of source code or, at least, of buildable source code). The tools can also be used individually to provide useful automation of traditionally labor-intensive tasks for preparing various types of artifacts for reasoning about and understanding the target software.

## CLARISSA <https://arcos-tools.org/tools/clarissa>

CLARISSA Tools consists of: (i) Assurance and Safety Case Environment (ASCE) which is the most widely adopted commercial software for the creation and management of safety and security assurance cases, and (ii) a goal-directed top-down solver for Constraints Answer Set Programs s(CASP) for reasoning about assurance cases using an enhanced Prolog engine.
ASCE has full support of Assurance 2.0 framework and enforces the methodology while it also facilitates systematic creation of Assurance 2.0 cases. The tool leverages theories, ensures the validity and soundness of the logical arguments with justifications while enabling active search for defeater and either sustaining or refuting them. Libraries of theories and defeaters are maintained as active repository of knowledge and known vulnerabilities. ASCE performs structural analysis to ensure their correct and complete construction while automatically analyzing specific syntactic elements of assurance cases including adherence to notations, grammar/spell-checks within natural language descriptions. ASCE automatically converts the assurance case to an equivalent logic program to support systematically reasoning with the s(CASP) engine.
The s(CASP) engine reasons over the semantics or underlying meaning of the claims, arguments, and evidence presented in assurance cases which includes various properties of the assurance case such as consistency (i.e. absence of logical contradictions), indefeasibility (i.e. absence of defeaters) and completeness (i.e. state of encompassing all the requisite elements), etc. This demonstration shows several assurance cases created with the ASCE software and allows the user to run different semantic analysis queries using the s(CASP) engine.

## DARPA's Automated Rapid Certification of Software (ARCOS) project called Rapid Assurance Curation Kit (RACK) <https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK>

Rapid Assurance Curation Kit is a semantic triplestore backed by an ontology. The ontology (or what we also call the data model) is tailored for curating evidence from certification artifacts of software systems. Evidence to show that a software package is fit-for-purpose can come from multiple subsystem providers, each generating data using different tools, in different formats, captured in different levels of granularity. As a curation platform, RACK uses its data model to normalize and organize the data. It also verifies that the ingested data is compliant with constraints specified by the data model, such as data types and cardinalities. RACK also takes as input the provenance of the data, as well as its relationship to the structure of the relevant system. Specifically, RACK provides a data ingestion interface for use by data providers whose primary focus is to generate evidence from which assurance arguments can be crafted. RACK also provides a query interface for use by data consumers whose primary focus is the construction of compelling assurance arguments. RACK queries allow users to find evidence related to diverse parts of the target system, understand where that evidence came from, and what the evidence infers about that system.

## CAID-tools <https://github.com/vu-isis/CAID-tools>

The CAID-tools are a software-suite for tracking dependencies across different types of tools and storages. At the core is the depi-server which provides a protocol for viewing, adding and linking resources (files, directories, models etc. in tools), reporting resource updates, etc. For each of the supported tools, there are user-interfaces (here implemented as vscode-extensions) and adapter/monitors that report resource updates. The currently supported tools are git, git-gsn and webgme.
